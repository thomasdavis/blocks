# Core Concepts

Blocks treats domain concepts as first-class, executable artifacts — inspired by Cube.dev, Malloy, and PDDL.

## The Three Pillars

### Entities

**Entities** are the "things" in your domain.

```yaml
domain:
  entities:
    user:
      fields: [id, name, email, created_at]
    resume:
      fields: [basics, work, education, skills]
```

Reference entities using `entity.<name>`:

```yaml
blocks:
  my_block:
    inputs:
      - name: user
        type: entity.user
```

### Signals

**Signals** are domain-specific concepts to extract or calculate.

```yaml
domain:
  signals:
    engagement:
      description: "How engaged is the user?"
      extraction_hint: "Based on activity frequency and recency"
    readability:
      description: "Clear visual hierarchy and typography"
```

Signals guide AI validation and give semantic meaning to data.

### Measures

**Measures** are constraints on output values.

```yaml
domain:
  measures:
    score_0_1:
      constraints:
        - "Value must be between 0 and 1."
        - "Higher values indicate stronger signal."
    semantic_html:
      constraints:
        - "Use semantic tags (header, main, section)"
        - "Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)"
```

Reference measures in outputs:

```yaml
blocks:
  my_block:
    outputs:
      - name: score
        measures: [score_0_1]
```

## Why Domain Modeling Matters

**Without domain modeling:**
- Developers hallucinate structures
- Conventions drift over time
- Semantic meaning is lost in code
- No consistency across blocks

**With domain modeling:**
- ✅ Explicit semantics
- ✅ Drift detection when changes occur
- ✅ Evolutionary design through negotiation
- ✅ Humans and AI agents maintain alignment through validation
