description: Understanding domain modeling in Blocks

Blocks treats domain concepts as first-class, executable artifacts — inspired by Cube.dev, Malloy, and PDDL.

## The Two Pillars

### Entities

**Entities** are the "things" in your domain.

```yaml
domain:
  entities:
    user:
      fields: [id, name, email, created_at]
    resume:
      fields: [basics, work, education, skills]
      optional: [certifications]
```

Reference entities using `entity.<name>`:

```yaml
blocks:
  my_block:
    inputs:
      - name: user
        type: entity.user
```

### Semantics

**Semantics** define your domain vocabulary — terms and concepts that give meaning to your data.

```yaml
domain:
  semantics:
    engagement:
      description: "How engaged is the user?"
      extraction_hint: "Based on activity frequency and recency"

    score_0_1:
      description: "Normalized score between 0 and 1"
      schema:
        type: number
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 1
```

Semantics can be purely conceptual (for AI context) or include constraints (with JSON Schema).

Reference semantics in outputs:

```yaml
blocks:
  my_block:
    outputs:
      - name: score
        semantics: [score_0_1]
```

## Why Domain Modeling Matters

**Without domain modeling:**
- Developers hallucinate structures
- Conventions drift over time
- Semantic meaning is lost in code
- No consistency across blocks

**With domain modeling:**
- ✅ Explicit semantics
- ✅ Drift detection when changes occur
- ✅ Evolutionary design through negotiation
- ✅ Humans and AI agents maintain alignment through validation
