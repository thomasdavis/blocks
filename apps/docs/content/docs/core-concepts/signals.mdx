# Signals

Signals are **domain-specific concepts** that you want to extract or calculate from your data.

## What Are Signals?

Signals represent abstract domain concepts that have meaning in your business logic:

- **Engagement** - How active is a user?
- **Culture Fit** - Does a candidate align with company values?
- **Readability** - Is this text easy to understand?
- **Professionalism** - Does this output meet business standards?

Signals are **not** simple data fields — they're higher-level concepts that require interpretation.

## Defining Signals

Define signals in `blocks.yml`:

```yaml title="blocks.yml"
domain:
  signals:
    engagement:
      description: "How engaged is the user?"
      extraction_hint: "Based on activity frequency and recency"

    civic_mindedness:
      description: "How community-oriented is the candidate?"
      extraction_hint: "Look for volunteer work, activism, community roles"

    readability:
      description: "Clear visual hierarchy and typography"
```

Each signal has:
- **description** - What this signal represents
- **extraction_hint** (optional) - Guide for how to calculate/extract it

## Using Signals

Signals guide AI validators and document domain intent.

### In Facet Blocks

Facets are blocks that extract signals:

```yaml
blocks:
  facet.civic_mindedness:
    type: facet
    description: "Extract civic-mindedness signal from candidate data"
    inputs:
      - name: candidate
        type: entity.candidate
    outputs:
      - name: civic_score
        measures: [score_0_1]
```

The block name `facet.civic_mindedness` maps to the `civic_mindedness` signal.

### In Domain Rules

Reference signals in domain rules:

```yaml
blocks:
  facet.civic_mindedness:
    domain_rules:
      - id: use_volunteer_data
        description: "Civic signal must analyze volunteer work and community involvement"
```

The domain validator will check that your implementation actually extracts the intended signal.

## Signal Extraction Hints

Extraction hints tell AI validators **how** to recognize proper signal extraction:

```yaml
domain:
  signals:
    culture_fit:
      description: "Behavioral and values alignment"
      extraction_hint: "Compare candidate values with job culture requirements. Consider: work style, communication preferences, team dynamics."
```

When validating, the AI uses these hints to verify your code implements the signal correctly.

## Signals vs Measures

**Signals** = What you're trying to find
**Measures** = Constraints on how you express it

Example:

```yaml
domain:
  signals:
    engagement:
      description: "User activity level"
      extraction_hint: "Recent activity frequency"

  measures:
    score_0_1:
      constraints:
        - "Value between 0 and 1"

blocks:
  calculate_engagement:
    outputs:
      - name: engagement_score
        measures: [score_0_1]  # HOW it's expressed
```

The signal (`engagement`) defines **what** you're calculating.
The measure (`score_0_1`) defines **how** it's represented.

## Validation

The domain validator checks:
- ✅ Signal is extracted using appropriate data
- ✅ Extraction follows the hint guidance
- ✅ Code expresses signal intent clearly
- ✅ Output actually represents the signal

### Example Validation

```typescript title="blocks/facet/civic_mindedness/block.ts"
// ❌ Bad: Doesn't actually extract civic-mindedness
export function civicMindedness(candidate: Candidate) {
  return { score: Math.random() };  // Random! Not civic at all
}
```

Validator output:
```
⚠ [domain] Implementation does not extract civic_mindedness signal
→ Expected: Analysis of volunteer work, community involvement
→ Found: Random number generation
```

```typescript title="blocks/facet/civic_mindedness/block.ts"
// ✅ Good: Actually extracts the signal
export function civicMindedness(candidate: Candidate) {
  const volunteerScore = candidate.volunteer_roles?.length || 0;
  const communityScore = candidate.community_involvement ? 1 : 0;
  const activismScore = candidate.activism_history?.length || 0;

  const totalSignals = volunteerScore + communityScore + activismScore;
  const score = Math.min(totalSignals / 5, 1.0);

  return { score };
}
```

## Example: Talent Matching Domain

```yaml
domain:
  signals:
    technical_strength:
      description: "Candidate's technical skill level"
      extraction_hint: "Evaluate: years of experience, project complexity, technologies mastered"

    culture_fit:
      description: "Alignment with company values and work style"
      extraction_hint: "Compare: work preferences, communication style, team dynamics"

    growth_potential:
      description: "Likelihood of skill development"
      extraction_hint: "Consider: learning history, adaptability, curiosity indicators"

blocks:
  facet.technical_strength:
    type: facet
    inputs:
      - name: candidate
        type: entity.candidate
    outputs:
      - name: strength_score
        measures: [score_0_1]

  facet.culture_fit:
    type: facet
    inputs:
      - name: candidate
        type: entity.candidate
      - name: job
        type: entity.job
    outputs:
      - name: fit_score
        measures: [score_0_1]
```

## Best Practices

### DO:

- ✅ Define signals that represent real domain concepts
- ✅ Write clear, specific extraction hints
- ✅ Use descriptive signal names
- ✅ Document why the signal matters to your domain

### DON'T:

- ❌ Create signals for simple data fields (`user_name`, `email_address`)
- ❌ Make signals too vague (`quality`, `score`)
- ❌ Duplicate signals across domains without reason
- ❌ Skip extraction hints for complex signals
