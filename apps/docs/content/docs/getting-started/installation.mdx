description: Install Blocks and configure your environment
---

Get Blocks up and running in your project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - Version 18 or higher
- **pnpm** - Version 9 or higher (recommended) or npm/yarn

## Install Blocks CLI

Install the Blocks CLI package in your project:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add -D @blocksai/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -D @blocksai/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @blocksai/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Initialize Configuration

Create a `blocks.yml` configuration file:

```bash
pnpm blocks init
```

This creates a basic configuration file in your project root:

```yaml title="blocks.yml"
project:
  name: "my-project"
  domain: "myproject.general"

philosophy:
  - "Blocks must be small, composable, deterministic."

domain:
  entities: {}
  signals: {}
  measures: {}

blocks: {}

validators:
  schema:
    - run: "schema.io.v1"
  shape:
    - run: "shape.structure.v1"
  domain:
    - run: "domain.semantics.v1"

pipeline:
  name: "default"
  steps:
    - id: "schema"
      run: "schema.io.v1"
    - id: "shape"
      run: "shape.structure.v1"
    - id: "domain"
      run: "domain.semantics.v1"
```

## Configure OpenAI API Key

Blocks uses OpenAI for AI-powered domain validation. You have two options:

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

To make this permanent, add it to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash title="~/.zshrc"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

### Option 2: .env File

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

The CLI will automatically load environment variables from `.env`.

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing your API key!
</Callout>

### Getting an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key and save it securely

## Verify Installation

Check that Blocks is installed correctly:

```bash
pnpm blocks --version
```

You should see the version number printed.

## What Happens Without an API Key?

Without an API key, domain validation will be skipped:

```
📦 Validating: my_block
  ✓ schema ok
  ✓ shape ok
  ⚠ [domain] AI validation failed: OpenAI API key is missing
```

Schema and shape validation will still work, but you won't get AI-powered semantic feedback.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Blocks installed, follow the [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) guide to create your first block.
