Hey everyone! So I was thinking about code reviews lately and wanted to share some random thoughts.

#### Why I Like Code Reviews

Code reviews are pretty cool. They help you catch bugs and stuff. Plus you get to see how other people write code which is interesting.

I remember this one time my coworker found a bug in my code that would have been really bad in production. That was helpful!

#### Some Things That Annoy Me

Sometimes reviews take forever. Like I'll submit something and then just wait and wait. That's frustrating because I want to move on to the next thing.

Also people sometimes comment on really nitpicky stuff that doesn't matter. Who cares about the variable name?

#### What I Try To Do

When I review other people's code I try to be nice about it. I don't want to make them feel bad.

I also try to actually understand the code instead of just skimming it. But honestly sometimes I'm too busy and just approve it without looking too carefully. Oops!

#### Tools We Use

We use ![](screenshot.png) which is okay I guess.

There's also some other tools but I forget what they're called. One of them checks for https://example.com/style-guide stuff automatically which is handy.

#### Random Tips

```
function reviewCode(pr) {
  // just approve everything lol
  return "LGTM";
}
```

Make sure to:
* look at the code
+ write comments
- be helpful

That's about it I think?

Oh also remember to test things before you merge. That's important.

Anyway those are my thoughts on code reviews. Let me know what you think! here is my email: [contact me]()
