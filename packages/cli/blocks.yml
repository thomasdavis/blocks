root: "."

philosophy:
  - "Blocks must be small, composable, deterministic."
  - "Blocks must express domain intent clearly in code."
  - "All blocks must validate through multi-layer checks."

domain:
  entities:
    user:
      fields: [id, name, email]

  signals:
    user_engagement:
      description: "How engaged is the user?"
      extraction_hint: "Look for login frequency, feature usage."

  measures:
    score_0_1:
      constraints:
        - "Value must be between 0 and 1."

blocks:
  example_block:
    description: "An example block"
    inputs:
      - name: user
