philosophy:
  - "Blocks must be small, composable, deterministic."
  - "Blocks must express domain intent clearly in code."
  - "All blocks must validate through multi-layer checks."

domain:
  entities:
    user:
      fields: [id, name, email]

  semantics:
    user_engagement:
      description: "How engaged is the user?"
      extraction_hint: "Look for login frequency, feature usage."

    score_0_1:
      description: "Value must be between 0 and 1."
