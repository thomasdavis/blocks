# Demonstrates the "file" source type — useful for small teams
# that keep shared config in a Git repo rather than a database.

domain:
  entities:
    rate_limit:
      fields: [limit, remaining, reset]

    rate_limiting:
      description: "Endpoints should respect and communicate rate limits"
      extraction_hint: "Look for rate limit headers or response fields"
